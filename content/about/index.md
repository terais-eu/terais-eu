**TERAIS** (Towards Excellent Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at a Slovak University)
is an international effort aimed at establishing
the [Department of Applied Informatics](https://dai.fmph.uniba.sk) (DAI)
of [**Comenius University Bratislava**](https://www.uniba.sk), Slovakia (UKBA)
as a workplace of international academic excellence.
Funded by the [**Horizon Europe
**](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en)
programme under the Twinning call,
the project brings together experts
from the [**University of Hamburg**](https://www.uni-hamburg.de) in Germany
and the [**Italian Institute of Technology**](https://www.iit.it) in Genoa
to collaborate with scientists at UKBA.

The project has four key pillars,
the development of people,
international networking,
research excellence,
and research support.
With a focus on cognitive robotics and artificial neural networks,
the joint research efforts aim to contribute
to the development of trustworthy and human-friendly robots.
The project will also focus on enhancing the human capital development
and research support structures at UKBA
and building long-term international research partnerships.

## Research excellence

TERAIS project aims to take the research and innovation at UKBA
to an international level by sharing knowledge and best practices
with distinguished academic partners.
The goal of the project is also to raise awareness
about the role of robotics and AI in a modern IT-based society
and increase the reputation and profile
of the Department of Applied Informatics at UKBA.
The purpose of the project is not only to mitigate the gap
between the coordinating and the partner institutions,
but also to enable the partners to enhance their networking opportunities
and contribute to the excellent research outcomes of all partners.

## International networking

International cooperation is at the heart of TERAIS,
with a focus on establishing long-term and sustainable
international research partnerships.
The project will also connect UKBA with other key players
in the local IT and AI ecosystem,
such as IT companies and technology start-ups.
Dissemination and communication will be fostered
through staff and student exchanges,
joint events, and joint funding proposals.

## Development of people

The TERAIS project will examine
the current conditions and needs of scientists at UKBA
and develop a plan to make human capital development
more systematic and lifelong.
The support regarding human capital development
will focus on the development and implementation
of the strategy for a life-long career development at multiple levels.
International staff and student exchanges
will also play an indispensable role in this process.

## Research support

The research support pillar shows the aim to ensure top-quality outcomes,
especially when it comes to collaboration
with other institutions or the business community.
The Department will establish its research support units
that go beyond basic administrative tasks to ensure sustainable functioning.
It would be also supported via establishment of project management
and administrative support systems at the Department and the Faculty
in order to assist researchers at all levels
to engage in new research projects and activities.

<p class="mt-4">
In conclusion,
TERAIS is a highly ambitious project
aimed at establishing UKBA as a hub of excellence
in the field of robotics and AI.
Through research support, knowledge-sharing, and international networking,
the project will help advance the field
and contribute to the development of cutting-edge technologies
that can have a positive impact on society.
