# Trustworthy Human-Robot Interaction Summer School

## Introduction

{{< figure src="thriss.svg" alt="THRISS logo"
lightbox="false" class="w-25 float-right mt-0 ml-3" >}}

The **Trustworthy Human-Robot Interaction Summer School** or **THRISS** welcomes participants from different backgrounds
to meet for four days and deepen their knowledge in the interdisciplinary fields of Cognitive Robotics and Human-Robot
Interaction. From Robotics Engineering to Computer Science, Social Psychology, Cognitive, and Neuroscience, etc., the
Summer School is designed for Ph.D. and experienced master's students willing to meet, discover, and learn about robotic
cognitive models to promote trustworthy social interactions with humans. The event is organized under the **TERAIS**
project within the international collaboration among the Comenius University of Bratislava (SK), the University of
Hamburg (DE), and the Italian Institute of Technology (IT). Participants will have the chance to join presentations andL
meetings with Keynote Speakers, practice with Workshops on Human-Robot Interaction, and expose their research at the
[**MEiCogSci**](https://www.meicogsci.eu/) Student Conference, connected with the Summer School.
THRISS is supported by the [**Slovak Society for Cognitive Science**](https://cogsci.fmph.uniba.sk/sskv/).

## About THRISS

Social interaction is not always an easy task. Others' behavior might be ambiguous and hard to grasp. As a result,
sometimes it is difficult to establish a common ground, the minimum grade of reciprocal understanding required for
interactions to be meaningful, and this is particularly true for social interactions between humans and robots, the
study of which is generally termed the Human-Robot Interaction or HRI. While humans develop their socio-cognitive
abilities for improving mutual understanding quite early in their lives, robots lack such skills. Utilizing cognitive
modeling within cognitive robotics is a way to make robots more considerate and aware of people as well as make their
behavior more legible and explainable and make robots more socially appealing and available. Not just the appearance,
but behavior and interaction of robots with humans should lead people to trust them, rendering this trust as justified.
At the intersection of Social Robotics, Human-Robot Interaction, and Cognitive Robotics, research calls for a
multidisciplinary effort. The Summer School on Cognitive Robotics for Social Interaction promotes this multifaceted
approach.

## Invited Speakers and Lecturers

<ul class="list-unstyled">

### Lectures

## Pablo Barros (Sony Corporation, Brussels, Belgium)

{{< figure src="speakers/pablo.png" alt="Pablo Barros"
lightbox="true" class="w-25 float-right mt-0 ml-3" >}}
<li>
<b>Bio:</b> Pablo Barros is currently a senior research Scientist at Sony Europe, in Belgium. Since he concluded his PhD at the University of Hamburg, He has worked on affective computing and social robotics over the past years, in particular on the modeling of intrinsic affect on dynamic and contextually rich interactions. His current research interests include the modeling of competitive and cooperative behavior in human dynamics, the exploration of explainable AI for affective perception, and the continual adaptation of social agents towards multiple persons.
</li>

<li><strong>Title: Towards Modeling Social Components of Trust in Competitive and Cooperative Game-Based Interactions</strong></li>

<li><b>Abstract:</b> Contextual games like complex card games and role-playing games (RPGs) offer rich, narrative-driven environments that are ideal for studying and modeling social constructs such as empathy, rivalry, trust, engagement, and competitiveness. These games require players to navigate complex emotional landscapes, make strategic decisions based on social cues, and engage in deep narrative experiences, all within a structured but highly flexible environment. By adding intelligent agents and robots into these scenarios, researchers can investigate how these systems can understand and replicate human social behaviors, adapt to emotional contexts, and contribute to shared experiences in meaningful ways. In this talk, I will present some of the research I have been doing in this area, in particular on the modeling of such social cues, and their implication on the development of high-level social constructs, such as trust.</li>

## Shelly Levy Tzedek (Ben Gurion University, Beersheba, Israel)

{{< figure src="speakers/shelley.jpeg" alt="Shelly Levy-Tzedek"
lightbox="true" class="w-25 float-right mt-0 ml-3" >}}
<li><b>Bio:</b> Shelly Levy-Tzedek is an associate professor and heads the Cognition, Aging and Rehabilitation laboratory at Ben-Gurion University. She obtained her B.Sc. degree summa cum laude in Bioengineering from UC Berkeley, and her M.Sc and Ph.D. degrees in Biological Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). She has been awarded a Horizon-2020 Marie Skłodowska Curie Visiting Professorship at the Institute of Advanced Studies at the University of Freiburg in Germany, the Pedagogica award for outstanding new researchers, and the Toronto Prize for excellence in research. In 2023 she was a Scholar-in-Residence at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden.</li>

<li><b>Title: Trusting Social Robots in Rehabilitation: Participatory design and ethical considerations</b></li>

<li><b>Abstract:</b> I will review studies in my lab, in which we collected, as part of the design process, qualitative data from the main stakeholders - including patients, family members and clinicians. I will argue that this helps minimize errors in the design process. I will then discuss how trust in the context of rehabilitation is different from other human-robot interaction context. I will end with the 10 questions I drafted with colleagues, which each robotic development team should be asked, so we can evaluate the benefit of their contribution to society. </li>

## Matthias Kerzel (University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany)

{{< figure src="speakers/matthias.jpg" alt="Matthias Kerzel"
lightbox="true" class="w-25 float-right mt-0 ml-3" >}}
<li><b>Bio:</b> Matthias Kerzel received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the University of Hamburg, Germany. He is currently a Knowledge Technology Engineer with the Knowledge Technology Group of Prof. Stefan Wermter, University of Hamburg. He has given lectures on knowledge processing in intelligent systems, neural networks, and
bio-inspired artificial intelligence. He is involved in the international SFB/TRR-169 large-scale project on crossmodal learning. His research interests include developmental neurorobotics, hybrid neurosymbolic architectures, explainable AI, and human–robot interaction. He is a board member of the European Neural Network Society (ENNS).
</li>

<li><b>Title:</b> Developing Research Platforms for Neuro-Cognitive Robotics</li>

<li><b>Abstract:</b> As AI researchers, why do we spend so much effort on robotic platforms? Do we really need one more dataset? No! However, we need an artificial agent that can autonomously collect its own data, make decisions to gather information and learn through interaction with a complex physical world. We need embodied agents to study HRI and hard-to-simulate tasks like haptic perception. To this end, we developed NICO and NICOL, the Neuro-Inspired Companion and the Neuro-Inspired Collaborator. In this talk, we present selected studies, conducted on these platforms, ranging from developmental robotics to HRI and XAI.</li>

## Alessandra Sciutti (Italian Institute of Technology, Genoa, Italy)

{{< figure src="speakers/alessandra.jpeg" alt="Alessandra Sciutti"
lightbox="true" class="w-25 float-right mt-0 ml-3" >}}
<li><b>Bio:</b> Alessandra Sciutti is Tenure Track Researcher, head of the CONTACT (COgNiTive Architecture for Collaborative Technologies) unit of the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT). With a background on Bioengineering, she received her Ph.D. in Humanoid Technologies from the University of Genova in 2010.

<li><b>Title:</b> A developmental perspective on cognitive robotics for interaction</li>

<li><b>Abstract:</b> This lecture will focus on cognitive robotics, discussing how to empower robots to establish more intelligent interactions with humans. The aim is to create robots that understand our needs, desires, and intentions while being transparent in their behavior. We discuss how cognitive robots can improve HRI through predictive capabilities, informed decision-making, and autonomous adaptation. Drawing inspiration from the natural progression of human cognitive skills since childhood, we propose a developmental approach for designing more human-centric machines better suited at interacting with us.</li>

<li><b>Title:</b> Programming for Trust: How Robot Behavior Influences Human Confidence</li>

<li><b>Abstract:</b> This workshop explores trust in human-robot interactions.We will start with a 20-minute theoretical overview of trust types and robot capabilities. This will be followed by a 2-hour practical session. Participants will design and test experiment scenarios to see how certain robot behaviors affect trust in robots. They’ll program these behaviors into robots using an easy coding tool integrated with ChatGPT, and then run experiments to observe the effects. The workshop concludes with a presentation of the results and participant feedback, offering both learning and hands-on experience in understanding robot trust dynamics.</li>

<li><b>Title:</b> Leveraging Binocular Vision and Deep Learning for 3D Scene Understanding with NICO</li>

<li><b>Abstract:</b> In this workshop we will leverage NICO's two eyes in combination with the camera geometry and deep learning to enable 3D scene understanding from the robot's perspective. We will cover the basics of monocular and stereo camera geometry and calibrate NICO's cameras using a calibration pattern. With the cameras calibrated we can measure 3D coordinates of different points seen in both images. We will use this in conjunction with deep learning methods relying on single RGB images to enable understanding of the scene.</li>

<li><b>Title:</b> AI Ethics: challenges and use-cases</li>

<li><b>Abstract:</b> AI tools are increasingly being deployed in all areas of life. Due to their disruptive potential, it is very important to perceive them not just as technologies, but as techno-social systems, and consider their ethical and societal aspects. This is an inherently interdisciplinary endeavor that requires more than just technical knowledge. In this practical workshop, the participants will be given real-world use cases of the deployment of intelligent technologies that bring up ethical questions.  They will team up to suggest solutions as an exercise in AI ethics-aware decision-making.</li>

<li><b>Title:</b> Sensorized devices for Human-aware human-robot Interaction</li>

<li><b>Abstract:</b> The development of robots’ abilities to engage in interactions with humans entails addressing a double direction: from the reception and processing of information coming from the human-populated environment to the design of robots’ behaviors to act towards it. This workshop will bring students hands-on experience on how to leverage different sensors (and hence multiple modalities) to develop skills to make robots interact with humans and the shared environment. Beyond cameras and microphones, a haptic device (the iCube) will be exploited to interact with the iCub robot simulator using the YARP middleware, Gazebo. With a modular approach, LLM-language reasoner and deep-learning computer vision and speech processing models will be complementary abilities to use and connect.</li>
