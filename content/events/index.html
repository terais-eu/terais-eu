      <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
      <p>Cognitive developmental robotics aims to develop robots capable of human-like learning, interaction, and
        behavior by grounding concrete and abstract concepts in sensorimotor experiences and social interactions. This
        talk introduced examples on language grounding in cognitive developmental robotics, and explores how principles
        like “starting small”, “embodied intelligence” and “super-embodiment” can address the limitations of AI tools,
        such as large language models (LLMs), which rely heavily on large datasets and lack sensorimotor grounding. By
        integrating incremental, multimodal learning and redefining embodiment to encompass physical, mental, and social
        processes, we can enable robots to better understand and utilize abstract concepts. The talk also reflects on
        the pros and cons of using foundation models in cognitive robotics.</p>

      <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
      <p>The strategic approach of the TERAIS research component is based on a multidisciplinary, goal-oriented
        methodology to drive the development of AI-powered humanoid robots capable of advanced human-robot interaction
        (HRI). Research part of TERAIS focuses on AI and how it can be applied to (mainly humanoid) robots, enabling
        them to seamlessly interact with humans. HRI requires that robots be trustworthy, that is, transparent in their
        behavior (explainable), as well as being able to understand human behavior (human-aware). In the project, we
        focus on these pillars by diving into HRI experimental methods, as well as cognitive robotics methods based on
        machine learning (mainly neural networks).</p>

      <p>Europe has taken a clear stand that we want AI, but we do not want just any AI. We want AI that we can trust.
        This talk presents ongoing research from the EU project TrustLLM which has the goal of developing more factual
        and trustworthy large language models. To achieve the ambitious objectives of this project, TrustLLM tackles the
        full range of challenges of LLM development, from ensuring sufficient quality and quantity of multilingual
        training data, to sustainable efficiency and effectiveness of model training, to enhancements and refinements
        for factual correctness, transparency, and trustworthiness, to a suite of holistic evaluation benchmarks
        validating the multi-dimensional objectives.</p>

      <p>To achieve excellence at an international scale, higher education institutions need to leverage effective
        models for support and organization of research. TERAIS tapped into this through a number of initiatives at the
        Department of Applied Informatics (DAI) aimed at restructuring of the research groups, development of a Research
        Support Unit, launch of a career development system for academic staff or introduction of a systematic support
        for internationalization and communication. Tatiana Jajcayova, associate professor serving as the DAI Chair,
        will share her insights from a three year-long journey of transformations. Discussion with other panelists will
        focus on comparing and contrasting experience from research settings in Sweden, Italy and Slovakia. During our
        discourse, we will aim to pinpoint approaches and models that could be inspirational for other Slovak academic
        workplaces.</p>

      <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
      <p>Research and academic institutions operate in a broader social context; therefore, they should seek how to
        translate their work into the results beneficial for the society in which they operate. In the case of digital
        technologies, collaboration with businesses is essential to creating innovations and bringing the research
        outcomes into life in practical settings. Our keynote speaker, Fabrizio Tubertini, from the Genova headquarters
        of the Italian Institute of Technology, has such collaboration under his skin as the Head of Industrial
        Partnerships and Licensing at IIT for more than 8 years. This allows him to serve as a bridge between the world
        of research and business. In his talk, he will review different aspects of technology transfer, guide us through
        the process of getting innovations from the lab to the market and provide useful tips on how to protect them –
        if needed. In the discussion, we will share the TERAIS lessons learnt in this area and identify international
        models and approaches to business-research collaborations that research institutions could find motivating.</p>
