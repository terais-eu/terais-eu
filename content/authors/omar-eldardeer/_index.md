Omar Eldardeer is a postdoctoral researcher at the Italian Institute of Technology in COgNiTive Architecture for
Collaborative Technologies (CONTACT) unit. His research focuses on building cognitive architectures for perception,
learning, and interaction for robots with the human in the loop. Typically in interaction or collaboration scenarios.

He earned his B.Eng. in Electrical Energy Engineering from Cairo University, Egypt. Followed by an M.Sc. in Artificial
Intelligence and Robotics from the University of Essex, UK with a thesis about multi-modal spatial awareness for robots
at home. He then obtained his Ph.D. in Bioengineering and Robotics from the University of Genoa and the Italian
Institute of Technology in the Robotics, Brain, and Cognitive Sciences (RBCS) unit, where he explored audio-visual
cognitive architectures for human-robot shared perception.

During his Ph.D. and postdoctoral research, Omar Eldardeer contributed to VOJEXT and APRIL EU projects and was a
visiting researcher at the University of Essex, the University of Lethbridge, and the University of Bremen at different
periods.
