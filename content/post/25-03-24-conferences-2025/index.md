The TERAIS research team is actively preparing submissions for two upcoming conferences in Europe, namely the IEEE ICDL 2025 in Prague, Czechia and ICANN 2025 in Kaunas, Lithuania. 

The IEEE International Conference on Development and Learning [ICDL 2025](https://icdl2025.fel.cvut.cz/) conference is a unique meeting gathering researchers from computer science, robotics, psychology, neuroscience, and other disciplines to share and discuss research on how humans and animals learn and develop and how this can inform and be informed by robotics and machine learning systems. The main organizer and general chair of this conference is Matej Hoffmann and one of the program chairs is TERAIS researcher Alessandra Sciutty from the IIT. The list of keynote speakers for this year include renowned researchers from the fields of neuroscience, cognitive psychology, developmental robotics and machine learning, among them the TERAIS scientific lead expert Giulio Sandini. The conference deadline for submission is coming soon - April 1, 2025. There is also a late breaking news track with abstracts to be submitted until June 13, 2025.

The 34th International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks [ICANN 2025](https://e-nns.org/icann2025/) is one of the premier conferences in the field of artificial intelligence, neural networks, neuroscience and brain-inspired computing in Europe, organized in collaboration with the European Neural Network Society ENNS. Within this conference TERAIS will be holding the third edition of the Special Session in Neurorobotics. Our special session is open for submissions of papers related mainly to cognitive neurorobotics and human-robot interaction. The main aim is to bring together researchers with diverse backgrounds and expertise to promote collaboration and knowledge sharing in this field, promoting the interdisciplinary research in machine learning, robotics and bio-inspired artificial intelligence. After the past two editions this has become a tradition and popular activity with a wide audience. The submission deadline for our session is April 30, 2025.
