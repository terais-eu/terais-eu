The Trustworthy Human-Robot Interaction Summer School or **THRISS** will take place on **10â€“13 June 2024** at the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics, Comenius University in Bratislava, Slovakia. It welcomes participants from different backgrounds to meet for four days and deepen their knowledge in the interdisciplinary fields of Cognitive Robotics and Human-Robot Interaction. From Robotics Engineering to Computer Science, Social Psychology, Cognitive, and Neuroscience, etc., the Summer School is designed for Ph.D. and experienced master's students willing to meet, discover, and learn about robotic cognitive models to promote trustworthy social interactions with humans.
