In October 2024, a second visit to the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT) was organised for six UKBA staff members,
as part of our commitment to fostering knowledge exchange and skill development within the DAI UKBA. This visit aimed to
build upon the foundations laid during the previous UKBA visit to IIT in January 2023.

The UKBA TERAIS team, comprising Igor Farkaš, Tatiana Jajcayová, Martin Homola, Daniela Olejárová, and Nina Zmajkovič
Kučeráková, was joined by Ján Čatloš, Head of the Project Support Centre at the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics, and
Informatics, UKBA. This visit provided an invaluable opportunity for the UKBA team to gain deeper insights into IIT's
expertise and operational excellence across several key areas, such as research support, human resources, technology
transfer, research communication and data management.  

Within the Research Support meeting, the UKBA team gained valuable insights into IIT’s structured approach to assisting
researchers throughout their research projects. The UKBA team explored the effectiveness of the institute’s research
support model and examined strategies for fostering collaboration between researchers and research managers to enhance
project outcomes. The delegation also delved into HR practices at the IIT, where they examined strategies that promote
innovation, efficiency, and a supportive research environment. Discussions highlighted policies aimed at improving
researchers’ well-being and professional development, as well as best practices in hiring and team structuring based on
dynamic project needs.

Technology Transfer was another key area of interest, with the UKBA team reviewing IIT’s approaches to industrial
collaboration and partnerships. IIT also introduced their guidelines for successful technology transfer, ensuring that
research innovations transition smoothly into practical applications. Additionally, we all explored intellectual
property protection guidelines and commercialization strategies to maximise research impact.
Effective Research Communication is vital for amplifying the reach and influence of scientific discoveries. The UKBA
team studied the operation of IIT’s communication department, learning best practices for conveying institutional
achievements and research findings to diverse audiences. We all also explored strategies for increasing the visibility
and impact of research through targeted communication efforts.

Lastly, the visit provided an opportunity to explore best practices in Data Management. The UKBA team examined IIT’s
methodologies for organizing and managing research data effectively while ensuring compliance with ethical and legal
standards. Discussions included innovative tools and frameworks for data handling, as well as protocols for data
security and protection. Throughout the visit, the UKBA delegation observed firsthand how IIT’s structured
organisational framework supports research excellence. The UKBA team was particularly impressed by IIT’s use of
data-driven decision-making in HR and research support, optimizing processes through systematic analysis.

The insights gained from this visit have directly influenced improvements within DAI UKBA’s knowledge transfer
initiatives, reinforcing the importance of effective research management, communication, and industrial collaboration.
These inspiring meetings enhance UKBA’s research capabilities and goal to ensure excellence in knowledge transfer,
research support, and innovation management.

This experience not only marked another step forward in UKBA’s research development journey but also laid the groundwork
for future collaborations and continuous improvement. The knowledge and best practices exchanged during this visit will
continue to shape UKBA’s strategic direction, fostering research excellence and innovation in the years to come.
