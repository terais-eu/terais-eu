In April 2025, **Dr. Omar Elderdeer** and **Dr. Marco Matarese** from the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT) made
their way
to Comenius University in Bratislava (UKBA), Slovakia. The visit was part of the networking and collaboration activities
in the project to strengthen ties between European institutions working in cutting-edge research activities
in **robotics** and **artificial intelligence (AI)**.

IIT researchers were warmly welcomed by the UKBA Terais team. Furthermore they all participated in a series of engaging
meetings and technical sessions. These sessions provided a platform for both parties to **showcase ongoing research
projects**, explore **mutual interests**, and reflect on challenges and advancements within the shared domain of
intelligent
systems and robotic technologies.

The researchers from IIT presented a range of their recent projects, shedding light on developments 
in **robot cognition**,
**explainability in robotics**, and **Human-Robot Interaction**. Their presentations were met with keen interest by the
hosting faculty and students, prompting stimulating discussions and insightful exchanges. At the same time, the Slovak
researchers offered a deep dive into their work, particularly within the framework of the **TERAIS project**.

“_What I really liked about the visit_,” said Omar Elderdeer, “_was to see how researchers in Bratislava were able to
overcome a lot of technical challenges throughout the TERAIS project and come up with many research outcomes in the
different pillars of the project with harmony and interaction._”

Omar's remarks highlighted the **integrated and coherent approach** taken by Comenius University researchers in
addressing
complex scientific problems. He particularly appreciated the **collaborative spirit and adaptability** shown by the
TERAIS
team in Bratislava, which are critical ingredients for success in long-term research efforts.

Echoing these sentiments, Marco Matarese emphasized the human dimension of the visit:

“_Comenius University Bratislava’s researchers impressed me with their enthusiasm and passion. Having met them allowed
me
to receive (and hopefully give) valuable insights and dive into fruitful discussions. Such talks reinforced in me the
awareness that dialogue — obviously about science, but also everyday life topics — is one of the most essential drives
for collaboration and research._”

Marco's reflection brought attention to the **value of interpersonal communication** in scientific progress. Beyond
technical discussions, the visit allowed both sides to engage in more informal conversations, reinforcing mutual
understanding and laying the groundwork for future joint ventures.

The exchange not only served to **advance academic dialogue** between the two institutions but also opened up concrete
opportunities for future cooperation. Both IIT and UKBA expressed interest in pursuing **joint research activities** and
**research exchanges in the upcoming future**.

In addition to the research discussions and technical exchanges, the visit also included a **planning meeting dedicated to
the upcoming closing event of the TERAIS project**. This session brought together key contributors to coordinate final
activities, discuss the structure and content of the event, and ensure alignment on organizational and scientific
objectives. The meeting served as an important milestone in preparing for a successful conclusion to the project,
highlighting the collaborative spirit and shared commitment among the partners.
